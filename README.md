## Project Overview

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This project aims to create a simple implementation of a blockchain using pure JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seobryn/Aethra.git cd Aethra && pnpm install
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can start the project by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start a simple server that you can use to interact with your blockchain.

## Testing

This project uses TDD (Test-Driven Development) best practices. To run the tests for this project, simply run the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will run all of the tests in the `test` directory and output the results to the console.

## Contributing
